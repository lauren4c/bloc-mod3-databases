> 2.Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.
A: A database is best used when multiple users/servers will be accessing the same data. A text file would be sufficient if only 1 user would be adding/editing/searching data at one time.

> 3.Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
A: SQL language is declarative, meaning that you ask for what you want, rather than other programming languages that use procedural languages to describe how to access the info.

> 4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
A: A database works much like a spreadsheet - there are rows of data that hold individual data sets, and there are columns of data. These columns hold like-values. Both rows and columns allow values to be searchable by queries.

> 5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
A: A table is the item that will hold all of the organized data. It is divided into rows and columns
A row is an individual data set of related information.
A Column holds like-data values (i.e. names, dates, id's would all be in their own columns).
The value is the individual piece of data, which sits at the intersection of a row and a column.

> 6. List three data types that can be used in a table.
A: String, integer, float
